## Putting It All Together
In a character sheet viewer/builder, you'll need a **relational** or **linked** approach where classes can point to their features and spell lists; races can point to their subraces; and so on. A typical data flow might look like this:

1. **Race** (and optional subrace) → modifies base stats, languages, traits.  
2. **Class** (and subclass) → modifies HP progression, spell progression, class features.  
3. **Background** → adds skill/tool proficiencies, equipment, and a special feature.  
4. **Feats** → modifies abilities, grants new proficiencies, or special actions.  
5. **Equipment** → modifies AC, attack damage, carrying capacity.  
6. **Spells** → each with own metadata (level, school, range, etc.) that tie back to the caster's class or subclass.  

Each sourcebook can add or modify any of these categories, so a flexible structure that supports expansions, overrides, and references is crucial.
